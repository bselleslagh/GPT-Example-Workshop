"Warranty and repairs
",What type of warranty do I have?,"You'll receive at least a 2-year warranty on manufacturing errors on all products. Your product shouldn't break during the first 2 years with normal use. We even offer a 5-year warranty on BlueBuilt products. Refurbished white goods products are an exception to this. These come with a 3-month warranty. The warranty type indicates how your product will be repaired. You can find the warrant type on the product page between the specifications of your products.  After you register the repair, you'll receive a shipping label. Send us your product or bring it to one of our stores. At your home. In this case, you don't send the product back yourself. After you register the repair, we'll contact you to determine the best solution."

",Is my repair free?,"Free repair in case of manufacturing error If your product breaks within the warranty period due to a manufacturing error, the repair is free. A manufacturer error causes your product to break sooner than expected with regular use. For example, the screen of your phone might break even though you did nothing unusual. Paid repairs for user damage If the defect is due to your own fault, this is called user damage. This isn't covered by the manufacturer's warranty. We're still happy to help you with the repairs, but you have to pay for them. We can't indicate what the costs will be in advance. We'll first inspect your product, give you a quote, and we'll wait for your decision before we start the repairs."
